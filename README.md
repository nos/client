# Releasing

## Windows & Linux

We use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nos/client) to automatically create builds based upon git tags.

1. Create a tag, e.g. `v1.0.0`.
   1. `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "release"` - the `v`-prefix is required for auto updates to work
   2. `git push origin v1.0.0`
2. Wait for `deploy_win64` and `deploy_linux` jobs to upload the artifacts to Github Release page as a draft.

## macOS

1. Export the following variables:
   1. `CSC_LINK` - This is the path to the .p12 certificate file
   2. `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` - This is the password of the .p12 certificate file
   3. `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY` - Set to `false` to disable usage of local keychain (By default it looks in your `login` keychain)
2. Create the distributable, i.e. `yarn dist`.
3. Locate and upload the following files as these are required for the auto-updater to work:
   1. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-mac.zip`
   2. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-mac.dmg`
   3. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-mac.dmg.blockmap`
   4. `dist/latest-mac.yml`

##### Generating hashes for the artifacts
- MacOS: `shasum -a 256 ./*` - Where the final argument is the location of the artifacts
