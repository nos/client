# Releasing

## Automated Deployment

We use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nos/client) to automatically create builds based upon git tags.

1. run `yarn release --dry-run` - Note if the output version tag/changelog is correctly generated.
2. run `yarn release` - This will generate the changelog, update the version in package.json and create and push a tag.
3. The deploys jobs will be triggered and upload the artifacts to Github Release page as a draft.

## Manual Deployment: macOS

1. Export the following variables:
   1. `CSC_LINK` - This is the path to the .p12 certificate file
   2. `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` - This is the password of the .p12 certificate file
   3. `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY` - Set to `false` to disable usage of local keychain (By default it looks in your `login` keychain)
   4. `GH_TOKEN` - This is used to upload the artifacts to Github
2. Create the distributable, i.e. `yarn dist`.
3. Locate and upload the following files as these are required for the auto-updater to work:
   1. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-mac.zip`
   2. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-mac.dmg`
   3. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-mac.dmg.blockmap`
   4. `dist/latest-mac.yml`

## Manual Deployment: Linux

1. Create the distributable, i.e. `yarn dist`.
2. Locate and upload the following files as these are required for the auto-updater to work:
   1. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-linux-amd64.snap`
   2. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage`
   3. `dist/latest-linux.yml`

## Manual Deployment: Windows

1. Export the following variables:
   1. `WIN_CSC_LINK` - This is the certificate file in text format
   2. `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` - This is the password of the certificate file
   3. `GH_TOKEN` - This is used to upload the artifacts to Github
2. Create the distributable, i.e. `yarn dist`.
3. Locate and upload the following files as these are required for the auto-updater to work:
   1. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-win.exe`
   2. `dist/nOS-1.0.0-win.exe.blockmap`
   3. `dist/latest.yml`

### Generating hashes for the artifacts

- MacOS/Linux: `shasum -a 256 ./*` - Where the final argument is the location of the artifacts
